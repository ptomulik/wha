WEBSITE (VIRTUAL HOST)
----------------------

Files/data related to virtual host/site:

  * apache's virtual host config
  * logrotate/newsyslog config
  * apache profile
  * database
  * document root directory

The above things should be generated from some predefined template. The
template should define form to ask user for necessary template parameters.

Virtual host templates may be stored under /usr/share/wha/vhost-templates/

USER (WEBMASTER)
----------------

Files related to user (webmaster):

  * entire home tree, especially:
  * .ssh/authorized_keys
  * log/xxx.yyy.zzz-*.log
  * www/xxx.yyy.zzz/*
  
Some substitutions may be necessary when creating user's files from skel. File
ownership and attributes must be modified to comply to sshd sftp-only
requirements and other custom rules.
  
In addition, we should keep track of:

  * contact information to webmaster
  * user quota (should it be per-vhost or per-user?)
